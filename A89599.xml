            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>But we ſhall not inſiſt upon any thing by way of Circumſtance; but rather interwove his life and converſation, with his preſent ſufferings, to wit, He was a Gentleman of known and faithful integrity to the Weal-publike of this Nation: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too dear did he prize, to purchaſe his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries liberty from tyranny and ſlavery: No meanes was left unaſſayed for the recovering of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born people of England from the Norman Yoke; And nothing did he eſteem, or hold in competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on leſs, than the expoſing of his life and fortunes, for the regaining of his Native Countries Liberties.

And whereas ſome are pleaſed to give out, that he was apprehended for Clipping and Coyning, it appears evident to the contrary, by the Sentence of Death pronounced againſt him at the Seſſions in the Old-bayley, where no ſuch Bill of Indictment was exhibited againſt him; nor no proceſs in Law, but onely upon the Account of killing the two Meſſengers in Alderſgate-ſtreet; which he did in his own defence; as appears by the ſubſequent matter in his ſpeech following. And as it may ſeem ſtrange to many, how he came now to be apprehended, the Work being done about 4 years ago: The truth on't is, it was revived and diſcovered by one Barefoot, who had incur'd the diſpleaſure of Authority, and ſhould (probably) have dyed for it; but onely a pardon was granted upon the revealing of this Gentleman: In purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance whereof, a pa ty of horſe were ſent to Canon houſe to apprehend him, (where many blows paſt between them) and from thence brought up to Newgate, moſt amen ably ſhot and mortified; and at the Seſſions tryed, convicted, and condemned, to be hang'd in Alderſgate-ſtreet, where he made this enſuing Speech.</p>
